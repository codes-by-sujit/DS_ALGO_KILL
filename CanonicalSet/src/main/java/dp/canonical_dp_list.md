# 🔥 Mastery Rule

You are DP-interview ready when:

* All Level 1–6 problems are 4 or 5.
* At least half of Level 7–9 are 4.
* You can derive transitions without memorizing.

---

If you'd like next, I can generate:

* A **Notion-style printable version**
* Or a **12-week execution plan aligned with your MAANG prep**
* Or a **DP invariant-building mini handbook**

Given your trajectory, I’d recommend the 12-week structured attack next.
